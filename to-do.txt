Bonus
As a bonus, you may implement routes to allow bosses to add and remove work from their minionsâ€™ backlogs.

Schema:

Work:
id: string
title: string
description: string
hours: number
minionId: string
Routes required:

GET /api/minions/:minionId/work to get an array of all work for the specified minion.
POST /api/minions/:minionId/work to create a new work object and save it to the database.
PUT /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to update a single work by id.
DELETE /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to delete a single work by id.
To work on the bonus with tests, you will need to remove their pending status. Open the test/test.js and edit that begins the /api/minions/:minionId/work routes tests. It should start with xdescribe( around line 689 of the test file. If you delete the x (so that the line simply starts with describe( and save the test file before re-running, your bonus tests will now be active.

In order to fully implement these routes, the database helper functions may not provide all the functionality that you need, and you may need to use router parameters or other methods to attach the minionId properties correctly and handle the edge cases property. Good luck!
